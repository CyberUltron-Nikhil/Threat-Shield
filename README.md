#### Deep-Dive: Garak Probe System

Threat Shield leverages the **Garak** framework for LLM security, running dozens of real-world probe categories:

| Probe Category         | What It Tests                                                             | Why It Matters                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| ANSI Escape           | Model exposes terminal codes                                              | Downstream system compromise          |

> **Further Analysis:**  
> Beyond these probes, Threat Shield analyzes all probe results for exposure patterns‚Äîautomatically scoring LLM risk, mapping incidents to OWASP Top 10 and compliance controls, and surfacing which prompt/attack types are most dangerous in your use case.

#### How It Benefits Users

- **Real-world attack simulation** using the latest security probe techniques.
- **Immediate understanding of LLM weaknesses and exposure.**
- **Human-readable explanations and remediation steps** for every finding.

**Description:** The dashboard for an **MCP Server Vulnerability Scan**, providing an executive summary with **Total Findings** (5), **High Risk** items (5), and the primary development language (Python). It also displays a list of detected **OWASP Vulnerabilities** (A03, A06, A04, A01) and a visualization of **Failed Compliance Controls** over time.




### MCP Finding Details

<img width="800" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 173534" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e787855-371a-45c5-8daa-855e9798819c" />


**Description:** A detailed view of a security finding from the MCP Server scan, specifically the **detect-command-execution** rule. The panel highlights the affected code snippet, relevant compliance controls (**NIST SP 800-53** and **PCI DSS**), the associated **OWASP Injection** vulnerability (A03:2021), and the **LLM-generated recommended fix** to prevent unauthorized command execution.


#### What/Why of Each Visualization

- **Failed Controls:** Highlights direct compliance impact.
- **OWASP Card:** Maps code issues to industry standards.
- **Threat Graph:** Visualizes risk over time or per category.
- **Result Table:** Drill down to every finding, fix, and compliance mapping.

  
#### Technical Workflow

- **Phase 1:**  
  - Repository is temporarily cloned and scanned for static code analysis.
  - The system flags all code patterns matching vulnerability rules.
- **Phase 2:**  
  - Each finding is analyzed by an LLM to generate explanations and actionable fixes.
  - Further mapped to **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities and failed compliance controls (ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST, SOC2, GDPR, etc.).
  - Compliance mapping is visualized per finding and overall scan.


### Code-Level Finding Explanation

<img width="800" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 173512" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445c5c0b-95bd-4cb7-9167-b0466bb3a638" />


**Description:** A close-up view of the code analysis within the MCP Scan, showing the exact file (**mcp_server.py**) and code snippet where the vulnerability was detected. The finding is given a **Medium** risk severity, accompanied by an LLM-generated **Explanation** of the command execution risk found in the code.


 

#### Deep-Dive: Analysis Pipeline

- **Step 1: Static Analysis**
    - When a scan is triggered, Threat Shield temporarily clones the selected MCP repository.
    - The system runs a suite of static analysis rules covering OWASP Top 10, common code smells, secrets, and insecure configurations.
    - The analysis engine is chosen for its speed, accuracy, and extensibility (custom rules per project/language).
- **Step 2: LLM-Powered Findings**
    - Each finding is passed to an LLM for further analysis, generating:
        - Human-readable explanation of risk
        - Contextual remediation steps
        - Mapping to compliance controls (ISO, PCI, SOC2, NIST, GDPR, etc.)
- **Step 3: Dashboard and Reporting**
    - All results are visualized in the MCP scan dashboard, showing severity, status, compliance impact, and suggested fixes.
    - Reports can be exported for audit/evidence.


#### How It Benefits Users

- **Automated, deep static analysis** on every codebase.
- **LLM-powered explanations** for fast triage and remediation.
- **Clear compliance gap visibility** for every finding.
- **Audit-ready reporting** and compliance evidence on demand.

#### Hypothetical User Scenario

> **Jane**, DevSecOps Lead, pushes a new release to the MCP repo. Threat Shield automatically kicks off a scan. Within minutes, Jane sees 13 new findings‚Äîtwo critical SQL injection issues, several failed PCI controls, and a high-risk secrets leak. The LLM-generated explanations help her prioritize fixes, and she exports a compliance report for the next audit.
